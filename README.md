Neural Network-Based Framework for Risk Mapping of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis Using Remote Sensing and GIS
ðŸ“„ Submitted to Environmental Research Communications
Study Overview
This work presents an integrated framework for the risk mapping of Zoonotic Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (ZCL), designed to capture the complex interactions between ecological drivers and disease distribution. The framework is implemented in three sequential phases:
1.	Generation of disease and environmental maps to ensure precise and reliable spatial inputs.
2.	Statistical analysis of ecologicalâ€“epidemiological associations using correlation and regression techniques.
3.	Neural networkâ€“based modeling for the production of high-resolution predictive risk maps.
The approach leverages:
â€¢	Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for preprocessing and spatial analysis.
â€¢	Statistical techniques (Pearson correlation and multiple regression) to quantify associations between environmental variables and ZCL incidence.
â€¢	Deep learning architectures (Multilayer Perceptron, 2D CNN, and 3D CNN) to achieve accurate predictive risk mapping.
Key Findings
â€¢	Temperature was identified as the strongest positive predictor of ZCL risk.
â€¢	Elevated risk was concentrated in the warm, arid western and southern regions of Ilam Province, while cooler, mountainous northern and eastern regions showed comparatively lower risk.
â€¢	Among the tested models, the 3D CNN architecture achieved the highest predictive accuracy.
â€¢	2030 projection maps, based on simulated environmental variables, suggest a southward shift in high-risk zones, highlighting areas that may require enhanced public health surveillance and intervention.
